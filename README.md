# Hello üëã, Allow Me to Introduce Myself

<!--Bio-->

‚úè PERSONAL
As a child growing up with nothing up north. I always thought my biggest obstacle was the lack of finances, esteem, brains, security, and physiological needs. Then I felt the Detroit, Michigan wind chill across my ears. The biggest obstacle was digging myself out of this unrelenting snow desert of knowledge. Every glimpse of knowledge from the history channel, science channel, school, small lego & kinetic creations, movies, and audiotapes warmed my heart and soul. Providing me with just enough warmth to continue moving forward in life.

Until I somehow made it into college at Texas A&M University-Texarkana. I discovered the power of the internet with the purchase of a necessary school laptop. From that moment forward, I took off academically, mentally, spiritually, and socially. Now I am obsessed with knowledge and chose to belly flop into a competitive field that is packed with booties. Hardware was my passion before discovering the fascinating world of software engineering & developing through college courses.

Now I am quickly obtaining the technical skills and tools needed to be successful in the software field. Every morning I am out of bed developing before the native birds have a chance to signal daylight.

I dream of working at a company that will push me to think in ways I never did before. I desired to work for a company where my daily efforts are contributing to the organization's bigger picture.
